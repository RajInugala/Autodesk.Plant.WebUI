## Instructions

1. Make sure you have these installed
  - [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [git](http://git-scm.com/)

2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (mac) or Gitbash (PC) 

    `git clone https://github.com/LyndaExerciseFiles/angular2-essential-training.git`
    
3. CD to the folder

    `cd angular2-essential-training`
    
4. Run the following to install the project dependencies:

    `npm install`
    
5. Run the npm start command to build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally:

    `npm start`

The repository has a branch for each video starting point. For example, the branch **02-01b** is used as the starting code for the video *02-01 NgModule and the root module*. You can checkout branches using `git checkout <branchname>` and not have to re-run `npm install` each time since you will remain in the same root folder.

Note that the site will run using `lite-server` and will be served up at the following local address:  
    http://localhost:3000

*If you use a code editor that launches its own web server please note that it may run on a different port number. 
You will want to use `npm start` for this project.*
